# Database-Project


The aim of this project is to demonstrate the user's ability to understand and develop a website using elements of php as well as an sql database.
The database language used for this project was Oracle 11g. Coding languages such as jquery, html, css and bootstrap are present as well.    


##Resources

This project uses open-sourced projects such as [DataTables] (https://datatables.net/), [jquery] (https://jquery.com/) and [Bootstrap] (http://getbootstrap.com/).


##Navigation

Opening the project starts off on a main page, where a user can log in as adminstrator (currently only myself) or as a guest.  This purpose is to prevent other users from going in and editting the table and destroying the tables.  As the user clicks on pictures, it links them to other webpages which are linked to the main webpages.  In this case, I've used the [League of Legends] (http://na.leagueoflegends.com/) webpage as a basis for source information as well as [Surrender @ 20] (http://www.surrenderat20.net/) for news regarding patches and other information.  

##Main Code File
The majority of the code can be found in the [index.html] (https://github.com/SmokedEel/Database-Project/blob/master/index.html) file as well as the [userPage.php] (https://github.com/SmokedEel/Database-Project/blob/master/userPage.php) file.  Any other php files are used to reload the pages with new information.
